        <p className="text-lg mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          Martial arts are various combat practices developed across different
          cultures, each with unique techniques and philosophies. While they
          teach valuable skills and promote fitness, martial arts should be seen
          as a last resort in self-defense. They complement self-defense
          strategies but are not the primary means of avoiding or de-escalating
          dangerous situations. Effective self-defense focuses on prevention,
          awareness, and having a plan to stay safe.

              Martial arts can broadly be categorized into two types: grappling
              and striking.
              <strong> Striking</strong> involves techniques that focus on
              hitting an opponent with punches, kicks, elbows, and knees. It
              emphasizes distance, speed, and power. On the other hand,{" "}
              <strong>grappling</strong> involves close-quarters techniques such
              as holds, locks, and throws. It focuses on controlling or subduing
              an opponent through leverage and technique rather than raw power.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white text-lg mt-4 max-w-md">
              Both grappling and striking have their own advantages and
              disadvantages. Striking can be effective in neutralizing threats
              from a distance, while grappling provides techniques for
              controlling or subduing an opponent up close. Ideally, a
              combination of both approaches offers a comprehensive skill set
              for self-defense.

          Tips in Choosing Martial Arts School

          Selecting the right martial arts school is crucial for achieving your
          personal goals and ensuring a positive and effective training
          experience. A good school will not only offer quality instruction but
          also provide a supportive and motivating environment. It&apos;s
          important to consider factors such as the instructor&apos;s
          qualifications, the school&apos;s reputation, class schedules, and the
          overall atmosphere. The right fit will help you stay committed and
          make the most out of your training journey.

            <p>
              Ensure the instructors are highly qualified and have extensive
              experience in their respective martial arts disciplines. Look for
              certifications, years of practice, and teaching experience.

            <p>
              Evaluate the class structure, including class sizes, frequency,
              and levels offered. Ensure the schedule aligns with your
              availability and that the class sizes are conducive to

              Take advantage of trial classes or introductory offers. This
              allows you to experience the teaching style, class dynamics, and
              see if the school meets your expectations before committing

              Ensure the school does not prioritize financial contributions over
              skill development. The focus should be on merit and progress
              rather than purchasing higher ranks or privileges.
